	      <strong style="color:#E00000"> Joe Root </strong> has admitted that England are facing some "tricky decisions" over the make-up of their XI for the day-night Test in Adelaide,
		   largely centred on the balance of the attack and the role spin might play.

		<p> The three quicks on display in Brisbane - Chris Woakes, Mark Wood and Ollie Robinson - were impressive during much of the second day
		before tiring under the onslaught by Travis Head. </p>
        
		<p> However, James Anderson and Stuart Broad <strong style="color:#E00000"> are both expected to play </strong> in the pink-ball encounter having sat out at the Gabba,
		while there is the looming decision on the position of left-arm spinner <strong style="color:#E00000"> Jack Leach </strong> after he went for 102 off 13 overs. </p>
		
		<p> Four years ago, England had Moeen Ali to provide the spin - though he went wicketless through 29 overs - and played four specialist quicks,
		all of whom are part of this tour. Whether they feel able to include Leach or offspinner Dom Bess this time around may come down to Ben Stokes'
		bowling ability following his jarred knee at the Gabba. </p>
		
		<p> Nathan Lyon has an impressive record in day-night Tests with 29 wickets at 27.41 (19 at 25.78 in Adelaide) and Head, who plays his domestic
		cricket for South Australia, expects spin to be a key element on a surface he called "thatchy". The forecast for Friday, the second day of the Test, is also for an expected high of 35 degrees. <p>

		  <p> As for Root, "[Spin] has generally played a good factor in recent times on this ground, especially as the game progresses, so it's something we'll have to look at.
		  [We'll] see where we are physically as a bowling group and how we can be balanced out." </p>
		  
		  <p> It would be a brave decision to play Leach again although Root reiterated what he said in the wake of the Brisbane defeat in terms of the fields he set and how he used the spinner. </p>
		  
		  <p> "A lot of that does come back on me. It was a risk, it could have created a couple of chances and put a dent in their innings," Root said. "I'm sure he [Leach] will want to respond and get back into the series.
		  I don't think it's as straightforward as looking at that as a concern. Actually, if you look at it, they [Australia] took an opportunity, played it pretty well, and if they try to do that on a wicket that's a bit more responsive then it brings him into the game even more." </p>
		  
		  </p> If Leach does play, it would mean two of the quicks from the opening Test missing out if Anderson and Broad both return. "It wasn't for our bowling display why we didn't win that game," Root said. "They have set the standard for the tour now." </p>
